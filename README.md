# üì± Automated Testing with React Native / Expo

## ‚úÖ Difference Between Unit Tests and End-to-End (E2E) Tests

**Unit tests** check **small, isolated units of code**, such as functions, hooks, or components.  
The goal is to ensure that **each part of the application works correctly in isolation**.

**E2E (End-to-End) tests**, on the other hand, simulate the **user behavior**, testing the **entire flow of the application** ‚Äî from interacting with the interface to communicating with services (such as login, registration, screen navigation).  
They ensure that the main features of the app work properly from start to finish.

| Test Type | Scope                          | Example                                                              |
|-----------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Unit Test | Isolated components or hooks   | Test if a button renders and triggers `onPress`                     |
| E2E Test  | Full app (user ‚Üí system flow)  | Test if the user can register and see a success message             |

## üß™ How to Run Unit Tests

To run unit tests using Jest:

```bash
yarn test -- -u
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installing and Running Maestro on Linux

[Maestro](https://maestro.mobile.dev/) is a tool for writing and executing E2E (End-to-End) test flows in mobile apps. Below are the steps to install and use it on Linux.

---

### üì• Step 1: Install Maestro on Linux

Run the following command in your terminal to install the latest version:

```bash
curl -fsSL "https://get.maestro.mobile.dev" | bash
```

After installation, the maestro CLI will be available globally.

### üÜô (Optional) Upgrade Maestro

To upgrade to the latest version of Maestro, simply run the installation script again:

```
curl -fsSL "https://get.maestro.mobile.dev" | bash
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Flow

To run your E2E test:

```bash
maestro test flows/register-user.yaml
```
Tip: Make sure your app is already running in the emulator or on a physical device before running the test.
